JSON Parser is a Rust crate that parses a JSON string so that the JSON data can be used in a Rust script

## Motivation

My interest in Rust is growing rapidly due to my boredom of TypeScript and Web Development. Making a JSON parser in Rust can possibly teach me a lot more about Rust than I currently know. Learning how to make a parser will also teach me about the steps to make a Lexer and a Parser. This is a stepping stone to making my own JavaScript interpreter, my Rust dream project.

## Features

-   JSON Parsing

## Usage

As of now, the Rust crate isn't available yet.

## Credits

I learnt how to downcast a trait object to a specific struct type from [here](https://bennetthardwick.com/rust/downcast-trait-object)<br>
I also learnt how to make a basic JSON parser from [here](https://notes.eatonphil.com/writing-a-simple-json-parser.html). I understood and improvised the way the author wrote the Lexer and Parsers to make the JSON parser more bug free

## Built with
